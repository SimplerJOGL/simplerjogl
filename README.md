SimplerJOGL
===========

A light-weight wrapper for the Java OpenGL binding.

SimplerJOGL is a wrapper for the [JOGL API][], designed for use in a
high school classroom. The wrapper shields new programmers from some of
the intricacies of [OpenGL][] and JOGL (and Swing and AWT), while
providing an entry point for delving deeper into all these subjects by
exploring the wrapper itself.

*This was originally written as a group of C++ classes when I was
teaching at the [Baylor School][]. I have since ported the idea (if not
the exact specifics) of those classes to Java for my classes at [St.
Mark's][]. This past semester, I started using SimplerJOGL by
introducing the Logo-esque [SimplerJOGL Drawing environment][].*
